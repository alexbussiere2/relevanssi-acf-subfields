## Description

Finds subfields from ACF and feeds them to the Relevanssi indexer so they're findable in search.

To have an ACF subfield, e.g. a Repeater, indexed, do this:

1. Go to the Relevanssi options
2. Scroll to "custom fields to index"
3. Add your fields in the format `[field_name]_%_[subfield_name]`, e.g. `sections_%_section_text`
4. Select "Build the Index", to recreate your Relevanssi index
